\section{\sc Education}
% Pros:
% 	•	Chronologically clear.
% 	•	Thesis titles and supervisors are provided.
% 	•	Includes thesis identifiers and links (great academic practice).

% Cons:
% 	•	Thesis links are too long—consider a single sentence summarizing each.
% 	•	Masters and Bachelor’s content could be condensed unless applying for early-career positions.

% Suggestions:
% 	•	Consider bullet formatting for readability:
